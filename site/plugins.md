TypeDoc will load plugins specified with the `--plugin` flag. There are a number of community developed plugins available for installation on npm.

You can find more plugins on npm using the [typedoc-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:typedoc-plugin) keyword.

For writing your own plugin, see the [Plugin Development](./development/plugins.md) page.
