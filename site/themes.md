Themes allow you to change the look and feel of the generated documentation.
The `--theme` option is used to change the selected theme.

TypeDoc ships with one builtin default theme, additional themes can be added by plugins.
For documentation on creating custom themes, see [Theme Development](development/themes.md) page.

If all you need to do is slightly change the generated output, the `--customCss` or `--customJs`
options may be sufficient.

You can find more themes on npm with the [typedoc-theme](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords:typedoc-plugin) keyword.
